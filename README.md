Titanic Survival Prediction
Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict the survival outcomes of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes the famous Titanic dataset, which contains various features about the passengers, such as age, gender, class, and more, to build predictive models that can estimate the likelihood of survival.
Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the Titanic dataset and develop a model that accurately predicts whether a passenger survived the disaster. By understanding the factors that influenced survival rates, we can gain insights into the historical event and the characteristics of the passengers.
Features
The dataset includes the following key features for each passenger:
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
Name: Name of the passenger
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents or children aboard
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Ticket fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:
Load the dataset and handle missing values.
Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize the data to understand the distribution of features and their relationships with survival.
Identify patterns and correlations that may influence survival rates.
Model Building:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Implement various machine learning algorithms, including:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Evaluation:
Compare the performance of different models to identify the best-performing one.
Use cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.
Prediction:
Use the trained model to predict survival outcomes for new data.
Conclusion
This project not only serves as a practical application of machine learning techniques but also provides valuable insights into the factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster. By analyzing historical data, we can better understand the dynamics of survival in critical situations
